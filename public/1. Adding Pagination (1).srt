1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,700
Welcome back to this court, so honest for you that, first of all, our nation in this first video

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,920
of the session supported, I will use a political presentation, which is quite popular package for

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,520
the nation.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,150
And this president looks like this here.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,260
OK, so first of all, it's all this president from here go back and I simply go to the new terminal

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,710
and put that here and install it.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,900
And then I go to my components and the home component.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:42,420
First of all, import that, so import the veggie nation from the.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:59,870
Oops, Vasteras dash pagination, and then I will use it after this section for displaying all the product

10
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,760
rooms.

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,410
So pagination.

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,850
And we have to actually wrap it inside.

13
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,320
A empty bags.

14
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,970
Like this and the pictures, we have to pass a lot of options, actually, first of all, I have to

15
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,690
display the active page.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,340
So what is the active page of the portrait?

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,990
Later than I have also posted here the items on the page.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,760
OK, so how many items want to display per page?

19
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,620
So for that I have to actually import from here.

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:58,780
On the state results page, then I will stay here, the room's count and then the filtered count like

21
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:07,480
this, so I will simply pass deserves a page right here, then have to pass.

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:20,410
The total items count so total items count in the rooms, count how many items have that is rooms count

23
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,070
all you have to give up on change.

24
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,740
That is basically a function.

25
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,050
So then the debate is change.

26
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,610
I have to do something, some sort of I set.

27
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,740
Front page.

28
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:49,480
No, I have the past couple of options, first of all, of the next page is equal to for next page text.

29
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,380
OK, that is going to be next.

30
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,450
These rules are not required.

31
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,740
This one is not required.

32
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,560
But I want to display the next and previous.

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:12,920
Also, OK, so for the previous display here, the previous model, if I go there, you can see that

34
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,650
here by default it will display these icons.

35
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,440
So I want to replace that for the next page, I believe.

36
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,980
What's next for the previous type here?

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,660
Previous and these are.

38
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,880
And this button and this is the first page and the last page.

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,360
So I'll use coastland last after next to previous.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,470
I also have right here first page text.

41
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,670
That is going to be first.

42
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:53,450
Then we have the last page text which is last, then display here, pass here the item

43
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,380
Glaus.

44
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,680
That is the item, because I have override these glasses.

45
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:12,950
I have changed the color and the UI a little bit, you can find those in the scenes.

46
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,900
That's fine, actually, if I go to Styles and global access.

47
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,850
And I called the these.

48
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:31,520
Some of them here, you will see that I have changed from color to the page color, paging over color.

49
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:40,900
So you have this over these tiles not as defined as function alerts, actually call this handle pagination

50
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,500
like this.

51
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,620
OK, simply copied from here.

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,170
Goldthorpe and I defined out here so const handle pagination.

53
00:04:51,370 --> 00:05:01,550
That is going to a function that will have the page number, which is the current page number that should

54
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,570
not give us, and then after getting the page and I simply have to go to that particular page number

55
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:18,010
of that products, what I do is right here, window door location, thought he should have is going

56
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,940
to be able to slash, which is the home page.

57
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,600
But now I will pass here.

58
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,540
That is called Page.

59
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:33,700
What is the page that pages page number that this will give us pagination.

60
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,010
OK, first of it.

61
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,240
And what is the error?

62
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:51,160
But we have to give the activation number, so now we are setting the page in the query so you can get

63
00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:01,450
the biscuit from the query, a similar type here calls the page from Roder query.

64
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,840
And we also have to import the water from the next selection order.

65
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:13,390
So import use, rather, from next.

66
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,280
Slash Roger and then I have to use this.

67
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:31,980
OK, it's not from the doctor or the current number, which is which will be in here.

68
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,970
OK, so by default there is not any page numbers also written here that by default the patient is going

69
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,730
to be one like this and.

70
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,790
And from the work we do, we get back our page in form of string, so we have to read that a number.

71
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:57,160
The the the page is equal to number and parts of the page, and we are overriding the value of page

72
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,360
led by default.

73
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,670
If you go to the home page without any page query, then in that case the patient is going to be one

74
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,550
by default and it can give us in springform.

75
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,930
So we convert that into the number.

76
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:20,350
And now I will pass this page as the current page in our active page like this subliterate and also

77
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,980
go back.

78
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,460
Let's close this one a little page.

79
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,950
You will see that you to have a patient here, surgical center as we go about maybe a score.

80
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:43,910
And what I do is I first of all, to type here a check that if reserves are paid is less, then so if

81
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,290
reserves per page is less, then the rules count.

82
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,120
OK, then I have to pay attention.

83
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,790
All right.

84
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,790
So I simply

85
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,820
this.

86
00:07:59,600 --> 00:07:59,920
OK.

87
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,040
So, for example, if the rumors are true and that's what we are just for, for definitely it doesn't

88
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,020
make any sense to discredit pagination.

89
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,630
So make sure that the results are paid is less than the rumors count.

90
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,820
OK, in this case only seven and eight is false or distraught to sample it.

91
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:27,680
I give it a glass display, Fleck's moocher class and then I type here justify.

92
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:42,810
Content center to center, and then I will also moderate both sides like this, and then I got this

93
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,960
live and wrapped inside that is like this and now I go back.

94
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:56,230
Now it is centered so I can see that we are getting only here two pages, one and two, because Fusspot

95
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,120
products are on first page and millions of products are on my second page.

96
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,980
If I want to, you will see that it goes to this is all pages equal to page number two.

97
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,450
But the products are the same because we also have to participate on our backend.

98
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:24,480
So now we successfully get paid is equal to what I do is I simply go back on your score and in the pages

99
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:34,460
in or whether it is index in those index number, you also have access here of quitte.

100
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:37,410
OK.

101
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,590
We as we have access to the programs, we also have access to liquidity, so nobody can pass here after

102
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,030
request.

103
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,450
I can also pass here the equity page.

104
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,110
OK, but what is the current page number?

105
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,220
Simply save it and then go back to my actions.

106
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:06,040
So the actions, actions and now here I will get my request and also have a look at the current page

107
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,420
number.

108
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,040
So by default, that is also going to be one here.

109
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:16,010
OK, if we don't get back any to page, no defaults on the first page.

110
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:22,750
So after the runes, I simply have to pass in here that page.

111
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:33,890
Is equal to the current rate like this and are also sending the request the back and if to go back.

112
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:43,890
Reload page, you will see that now on page two and we are seeing the military are rooms, if I go to

113
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,730
one more page called one and we are displaying all the rooms.

114
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:56,730
And even though if I remove this page and now is on the one to go to, if I go back to my escort in

115
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,280
the controllers room controllers, I change per page proposal.

116
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,140
It.

117
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:11,430
So close, this one, this one month ago, back if I paid, you will see that on page two.

118
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:18,010
We have one group products, but now we have these four pages here because now they are displaying truisms

119
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,560
but bit like this.

120
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,610
OK, so this one that was also implemented successfully here, I hope I understand in my next video,

121
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,070
I will also handle this search functionality in this project.

122
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,230
OK, so I will see you the next video.
